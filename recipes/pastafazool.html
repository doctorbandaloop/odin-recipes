  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Pasta Fazool is one of my favorite dishes. It brings me right back to grandma's house.
    Of course when I was a small child I refused to eat the cannalini beans, so really it 
    was just a bowl of elbow macaroni with some thin tomato sauce. Now-a-days, I make it
    with plenty of beans and extra fixins.
